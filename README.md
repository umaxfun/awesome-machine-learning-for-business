A curated list of awesome Machine Learning algorithms which can directly benefit your business or app without data scientist required.

Machine learning frameworks, libraries, middleware, and other software with data scientists as a primary audience is **explicitly banned**.

* [Recommendations and Forecasting](#recommendations-and-forecasting)
* [Computer Vision](#computer-vision)
* [Speech to Text to Speech](#speech-to-text-to-speech)
* [Machine Translation](#machine-translation)
* [Natural Language Processing](#natural-language-processing)
* [Chat Bots](#chat-bots)
* [Combined Offerings](#combined-offerings)

## Ground Rules of this list

1. Products included in this list should be usable without data analyst, data scientist, ML Engineer, or anyone alike. Common roles like Systems Analyst and Software Developer should be enough to make use of.
2. Products included in this list should offer clear business value.

**ðŸ˜±Ultra Bad example:** BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is applying the bidirectional training of Transformer, a popular attention model, to language modeling. **Why ultra bad:** WHUUUT?! This kind of project should be listed in some data science list, not in the business one :)

**ðŸ‘ŽBad example:** A service that can transfer style from Picasso painting to the supplied photo. **Why bad:** the service drives no obvious business benefit, it exists just for fun and pure science. This kind of project should be listed in some data science list, not in the business one.

**ðŸ¤žMedium example**: a service that can tell what objects reside on the supplied photo. **Why medium:** the service can offer business benefit in some rare case. E.g. when you have a big bunch of the photos and want to index them all; exists as a part of a larger solution.

**ðŸ’ªGood example**: a service which can extract text from scanned invoices. **Why good:** the service has a clear business value, and can be directly evaluated and used, such projects are most welcome here.

3. Every product included in this list should be offered for immediate use, online, without any kind of "Contact Us" or "Request Quote" walls, however, credit card information and/or company data may be required for the access.
4. To be highlighted every product included in this list should have a demo page where everyone may supply his or her data and get the result.
